# Python Lists

This folder documents my in-depth learning of **Python Lists** as part of my **Data Science learning journey**.

Lists are one of the most important data structures in Python and are widely used for storing, processing, and manipulating collections of data.

## Learning Objectives
- Build a strong conceptual foundation of Python lists
- Understand how list operations work internally
- Use lists confidently in real-world and data-related problems
- Prepare for Python and Data Science interviews
