# Python Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)

This folder contains a detailed and structured study of **Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python**, focused on building strong foundations required for **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Development**.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Classes and Objects  
- Attributes and Methods  
- Constructor (`__init__`)  
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  
- Real-life and Data Science–oriented examples  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how real-world entities are modeled using classes and objects  
- Write reusable, scalable, and maintainable Python code  
- Prepare for **Data Science interviews** where OOP concepts are frequently tested  

## 🧠 Why OOPs for Data Science?
OOPs helps in organizing:
- Datasets  
- Feature engineering pipelines  
- Machine learning models  
- Training and evaluation workflows  

Most production-level ML systems are built using OOP principles.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
Each notebook focuses on **one core OOP concept**, explained with:
- Clear theory
- Step-by-step code
- Real-life analogies
- Data Science–oriented use cases
