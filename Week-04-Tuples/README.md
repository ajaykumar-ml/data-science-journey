# 📘 Week-04: Python Tuples

This folder contains my learning of **Python Tuples**, focusing on immutability, safe data storage, and comparison with lists.  
Notebook numbering continues from the previous week for consistency.

---

## 📂 Notebooks Overview

- **`27_Tuple_Basics.ipynb`**  
  Introduction to tuples, their properties, and immutability.

- **`28_Tuple_Creation_and_Access.ipynb`**  
  Creating tuples, indexing, slicing, and unpacking.

- **`29_Tuple_Operations_and_Methods.ipynb`**  
  Tuple operations, built-in methods, and common use cases.

- **`30_Tuple_vs_List.ipynb`**  
  Comparison between tuples and lists in terms of mutability, performance, and safety.

---

## 🎯 Outcome
After completing this section, I will understand when to use tuples instead of lists and how immutability helps in writing safer and more predictable code.
