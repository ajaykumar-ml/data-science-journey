# 📘 Week-04: Python Tuples

This folder covers my learning of **Python Tuples**, focusing on immutability, safe data storage, and real-life use cases.

All core tuple concepts are intentionally covered in a **single notebook** for clarity and completeness.

## 📂 Notebook

- **`27_Tuples.ipynb`**  
  Covers:
  - What tuples are and why they are used  
  - Tuple creation (all methods, including single-element tuples)  
  - Indexing, slicing, and accessing elements  
  - Immutability and its importance  
  - Tuple operations and built-in methods  
  - Packing and unpacking

## 🎯 Outcome
After completing this notebook, I understand when and why to use tuples, and how immutability helps in writing safer and more predictable Python code.
