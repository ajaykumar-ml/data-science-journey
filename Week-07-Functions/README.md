# Python Functions

This folder covers the fundamentals of Python functions as part of my Data Science learning journey.

## Topics Covered
- Function basics and syntax
- Parameters and return values
- Default and keyword arguments
- Real-life and Data Science examples

## Why Functions Matter
Functions help write reusable, modular, and clean code, which is essential for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building scalable Data Science workflows.

Each notebook focuses on one concept with clear explanations and practical examples.
