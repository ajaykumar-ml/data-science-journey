# Week-05: Python Sets

## 📌 Overview
This week focuses on **Python Sets**, an unordered collection data type used to store **unique elements**.  
Sets are extremely useful when working with **duplicates removal, membership testing, and mathematical set operations**.

This folder is part of my **Core Python learning phase** for building a **strong Data Science foundation**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this week, I learned:
- What sets are and why they are used
- How to create sets in different ways
- Properties and limitations of sets
- Common set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
- Built-in set methods with examples
- Practical use cases of sets in problem-solving
